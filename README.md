##Directions on using Github, Git, and VS Code

GitHub: Github is a code hosting platform that allows you to collab with other people and do version control. It helps back up your code too. It can contain any type of folders like HTML, CSS, Javascript etc... it to get started you would first need to make an account then once you do you can create a new repositry right away which shows on your left side of your screen then once you do you can choose what you can do with your repository and create a readme file like I'm doing right now. That simple!

Git: Git is a version control system that helps you keep tracks of changes and creates a local repsositry in your computer which basically acts as a backup for your code base. When you create changes to your code Git will take a snapcshot of your code at the point in time. Which is saved in the local reposistry and can be pushed to github. You can make a branch to work on different versions of your code at the same time then merge them later on.

VS Code: For VS Code after you install it first open a folder then setup your then open it. On the far left you have a ativity bar to see folders and files that has many features like the search bar, source control, run and debug to exticute code, and extensions. Then look up click on View then click on command pilot which is your control center for all commands. When you create a new file VS Code will try to see what type of code that your trying to write so it will show on the bottom right. To save code click on file the click auto save. To extension click on the extension tab and you can search up any that you would like.

##Glossery
**Branch** - parallel version of the repository which lets you work on different versions of a project at the very same time.
**Clone** - Creating a copy of a repository.
**Commit** - snapshot of your own repository from a point in time.
**Fetch** - downloading changes from the remote repository without having to apply them to your own local repository.
**Git** - open source version control system that tracks changes in code.
**Merge** - basically combining two breanches into one.
**Merge Conflict** - when Git cant automatically resolve differences between the two branches.
**Push** - sending local changes to the remote GitHub repository.
**Pull** - downloading changes from a remote GitHub repository onto your own local machine.
**Remote** - version of your own project that can be hosted onto the internet like github for example.
**Repository** - project directory that stores all your files and history.
